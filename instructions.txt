Part 2: Guessing Game

Create a new file called game.py. In it, write a Python program that that allows the user to play the classic number guessing game. The game will work like this:

    The computer will choose a random number between 1–100 and ask the user to guess the number

    Once the user guesses, the computer will tell the user if their guess was too high or too low

    The game is over once the user guesses the computer’s number. When the game is over, the computer the total number of guesses the user made before getting the right answer.

Here’s the terminal output for an example game:

Here’s a rough pseudocode outline of the program that gave this output:

greet player
get player name
choose random number between 1 and 100
repeat forever:
    get guess
    if guess is incorrect:
        give hint
        increase number of guesses
    else:
        congratulate player
